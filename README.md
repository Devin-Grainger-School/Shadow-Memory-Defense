# Shadow-Memory-Defense

My first mini-game. A game where "Memory" and her inner demon, "Shadow", work together to protect themselves from monsters.



Controls:
WASD - Movement

IJKL - Throw Sluggers (Attack)

How to Play:

You move "Shadow Memory" (your character) around killing as many monsters as you can for as long as you can without any of them touching you.



Dev Log:
2 Different attack methods



Assets:
All assets are drawn by me

The character of "Memory" comes from Identity V and is owned by NetEase games. Rights to the character goes to them.
