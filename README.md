# Shadow-Memory-Defense

My first mini-game. A game where "Memory" and her inner demon, "Shadow", work together to protect themselves from monsters.



Controls:
WASD - Movement

IJKL - Throw Sluggers (Attack)

Space - Place Memory Fragment (Mine)



How to Play:

You move "Shadow Memory" (your character) around killing as many monsters as you can for as long as you can without any of them touching you.



Assets:
All assets are drawn by me

The character of "Memory" comes from Identity V and is owned by NetEase games. Rights to the character goes to them.



Dev Log:
I made this in my college class with all the knowledge I gained in the first 4 weeks of class. So far I gave the character movement 2 different types of attacks. An enemy AI that follows the player no matter what. Also I added font from Identity V to fit with the character. I would like to add a limit on the amount of projectiles thrown to 2 and the amount of Memory Fragments/Pages to 3 so you can't just spam them, but I still haven't learned that yet. I also want to add spawners on the left and right of the player but it isn't working for some reason. If anyone has any idea on how to do that please contact me.​
